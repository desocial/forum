This is a decentralized forum built upon the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create topics and posts and comunicate with all the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain: no censorship or downtime.

The code is still work in progress but we hope that it will soon be completed, we are also working on a test suite, user interface for both local use and an external website for less technical users to help them get started. We plan on getting it fully audited so users can be sure that the fundementals are secure.

There are other projects we hope to merge into this in the future and we leave the platform open to other projects that may wish to jump on board. The features of this version are basic but we plan to expand them on a later version.

Once we have done some other checks we will be releasing it on the testnet, we are unsure exactly which one as there are several. But since the code is up feel free to deploy it yourself at your lesure.

NOTE: The code is not yet finalized and if you occur any losses / issues it is not our fault.
